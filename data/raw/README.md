- **data/raw** contains all the raw data (which is not generated by the code in this project).
    - It is version controlled using DVC, which places pointers to the underlying data in the git repository. The actual data is stored remotely in the cloud, and then synced into the repository using DVC.
    - **Each raw data source must be documented in `source.yaml`**
